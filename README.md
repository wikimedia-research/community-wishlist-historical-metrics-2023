# Community Wishlist Survey Historical Metrics 2023

The [Community Wishlist Survey](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Community_Wishlist_Survey) (hereinafter CWS) is an annual survey that allows contributors to the Wikimedia projects to propose and vote for tools and platform improvements. The survey had eight iterations since its inception in 2015, the last one being in 2023. The [Community Tech](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Community_Tech) team usually handles the technical development of the selected wishes, along with running the survey itself. In some cases, wishes have also been completed by volunteers or staff from other teams with little to no input from the Community Tech team.

As of December 2023, the Community Tech is working on analysing the feedback and participation from previous years to understand how this process could be improved to keep up with the growing needs of the movement, referred to as the [Future of the Wishlist](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Community_Wishlist_Survey/Future_Of_The_Wishlist). The historical metrics analysis is intended to support this process by surfacing historical trends of survey. The majority of the report focuses on community participation i.e. who have been participating, where the users come from (home wiki), their experience level etc.
